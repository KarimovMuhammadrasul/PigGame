A fast-paced 2-player dice game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Players take turns rolling the dice — roll 2–6 to build your score, but roll 1 and lose it all.
Choose TAKE to save your points and pass the turn.
First to reach 20 total points wins!

Simple rules, clean design, and a touch of strategy.
